## About me

Hi! I am a JC1 student currently attending Hwa Chong Institution.

In this blog you might find CTF writeups(mainly cryptography problems), maths/programming notes, my personal projects, and some mysterious fourth thing maybe?

I have always had a lot of interests and it is difficult to give attention to each one. One thing I am struggling with right now is juggling my schoolwork with my hobbies.

I am always eager for an internship.
