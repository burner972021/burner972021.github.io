# Motive

I feel really inspired by the employment, or rather, unemployment culture that I have seen on Instagram Reels. Hence I decided to make a game to cater to those who may not have the chance to experience a job. I hope this game will be an immersive and enriching experience for everyone, and that those who play my game will learn something from it :)

# Stages

The game would comprise 4 phases for each cycle.

- Phase #1: Unemployment
- Phase #2: Interviews
- Phase #3: Employment (yay!!!)
- Phase #4: Layoffs (no!!!)
